# Ledger

Ledger is a blocklogging and entity-event logging mod very similar in comparison to the [Coreprotect Plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/coreprotect.8631/) for bukkit servers.
Ledger can log blocks broken, placed, entities and mobs killed, and chest transactions in and out, all of which also show the cause of said event, whether that be a player or minecraft mob/entity.

Normal players now have acess to the ledger `/lg inspect` (or `/lg i` for short) command! To use this, you simply type `/lg inspect` into your chat bar and it will put you into **inspect mode**. To use inspect mode, left click on any block-space you think has been broken or placed, or any chest you think someone has added to or taken from. If there has been any transactions on that block or in that chest that you inspected since I've added the ledger mod to the server, it will display them in an orderly list for you. This way you can prove or disprove your itching paranoia. To exit inspect mode and get back to normal playing, type `/lg inspect` or `/lg i` again in your chat bar. If you have proof that someone has griefed you or stolen from you, contact one of the minecraft server administrators and they will attempt to repair your situation.
