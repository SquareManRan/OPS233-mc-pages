# Voice Chat

Our server makes use of the [Simple Voice Chat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat) for fabric mod loader made by user [henkelmax.](https://www.curseforge.com/members/henkelmax/projects)
Unfortunately, since the mod requires the *player* to also have the mod installed on their client for that player to be able to use the voice chat feature, this mod is only for minecraft java players to enjoy.

Note: this mod is completely optional, you can connect from any vanilla client that does not have this mod and play fine, just with no voice chat capibilities.

To install the mod:

1. First you will need to install fabric mod loader on your client. You can follow the directions on how to to that [here.](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/player:tutorials:install_mcl:windows)
2. Next, you'll need to head over to the mod's [file page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat/files), and download the latest mod version for your game version. e.g. latest mod version for 1.17.0 at the time of writing this.
3. You'll need to put that .jar file into the `mods` folder of your `.minecraft directory.` You can find this directory by pressing windows key + r, typing in `%appdata%` into the window, and pressing enter. then you should see a `.minecraft` folder near the top, double click into that and you should be in your `.minecraft` directory!
4. You will also need to download the `fabric API` mod from [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files) and put that `.jar` file into the same place as the last one for the voice chat mod to work.

You can visit the mod page for more info on features but a few tips to start out with:

- Look in your controls and change the open gui button to one of your liking to change all of your voice chat settings, including audio input and output device.
- Change your voice chat push to talk key to be one that you see yourself being able to easily press while performing other minecraft tasks (also found in the default controls settings in minecraft).
