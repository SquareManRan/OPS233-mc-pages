# Spawn

For this run of the OPS Minecraft server, we have put a significant twist on the spawn area.

As you can tell, something looks a bit different. Some of you may recognize that kind of generation, and yes, it is the farlands. Using some trickery and taking advantage of different world generation mechanics, I was able to brind the farlands to spawn.
But don't worry! It only continues for a little over 300 blocks in each direction. After that, the farlands taper off, blending into the surrounding terrain.
The rest of the server is 100% vanilla 1.18.1 world generation. The only thing changed is the center overworld spawn.

Spawn protection rules:
- Players cannot be hurt within center spawn protection.
- Blocks cannot be broken nor placed within center spawn protection.
- No kinds of mobs, peaceful or hostile, spawn within center spawn protection. Any mobs that are alredy there, you cannot hurt.
- Some blocks can be interacted with. For example: beds, doors, chests, enderchests, and barrels. Feel free to make use of any that you're able to.

In the farlands area of spawn, the rules are set so everything happens almost fully normally, except that hostile mobs don't spawn. This is mainly for mobcap reasons.
You are allowed to hang out or even base in the farlands, but it is greatly encouraged to branch out outside of the spawn generation instead.
Ideally, players should only be at spawn if they are joining for the first time or respawning.
