# Auto Crafting

Our server makes use of [Carpetmod](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) developed by [Gnembon](https://www.youtube.com/c/gnembon/featured), and specifically Carpet's [Autocrafting](https://github.com/gnembon/carpet-autoCraftingTable) extension mod.
This allows the use of hoppers to be hooked into the top, sides, and bottom of a crafting table much like a furnace or brewing stand in vanilla. Doing this allows for making complex restone machines that lock and unlock hoppers in certian orders to create and complete crafting recipies and output them into a hopper underneath.

This mod is used on the Peacefull Challenge server, and appears in many of [Ilmango's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHSI8erNrN6hs3sUK6oONLA/videos) videos as he plays on the server and uses the mod to make impressive redstone autocrafting machines.

Some other videos on using the mod can be found [here](https://youtu.be/IJTeOBo6fMk) for some quick tutuorials and [here](https://youtu.be/n1WCEBdAfQ4) for a video by lovely MumboJumbo.
