# Deepslate / Logs Instamine

[This mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/deepslate-instamine) allows deepslate to be instamined when you have both, an `efficiency 5 netherite pickaxe`, as well as the `haste 2` beacon effect.

Similarly, this mod also allows tree logs to be instamined when you have an `efficiency 5 netherite axe` as well as `haste 2`.

The last feature of this mod, is a change in behaviour when lava pours over top of water source blocks under `y level 11`. Instead of creating stone as normal, it crates deepslate. This can be used to create a simple renewable deepslate generator instead of only being able to mine out big areas to get large amounts of deepslate.
