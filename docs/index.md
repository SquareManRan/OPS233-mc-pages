## Welcome

This simple website should tell you everything you need to know about the Minecraft server's features, as well as how to connect and play. Use the dropdowns on the side of this website to help navigate your way to all of the other info. This time around, we will **not** be starting over the world when the next update comes out. Enjoy!

## Connecting to the Server

If you would like to join and play on the server:

- First, please make sure you are in the OPS233 Gaming club [discord server.](https://discord.gg/sa6EMFHMXS)
- Make sure you are using the same Minecraft version as the server, at the time of making this, we are in 1.18.1
- If you are a bedrock player, head over to your platform under the bedrock dropdown.
- The IP address for the Minecraft server is: `OPS233.ddns.net`
- Upon first connection, you will be refused to join, and told to type `/link` to link your account. You need a linked account to be able to play on the server. To do this, follow these steps:
    1. Attempt to connect to the Minecraft server, and stay on the screen that pops up.
    2. Join and open the OPS233 Gaming Club discord server.
    3. Navigate to the `minecraft-server-chat` text channel.
    4. In this channel, type `/link code: ` followed by the code that is given to you in the link screen on Minecraft. Make sure that there is a space after the colon and before your code.
    5. Assuming you typed in the message correctly, your minecraft account should now be linked to your discord account, and you can try again to connect to the server and play.
- Don't worry, this information is not sent anywhere. This just keeps track on the management side of things what discord username aligns to which Minecraft accounts, for moderation purposes only.

## Rules

1. No cheating. This includes xray and baritone, as well as cheat clients or other third party software designed to give you an advantage over other players.
2. No hate speech or discrimination.
3. No unnecessary griefing. Simple enough, don't destroy or steal other player's property. You'll just be found out and banned, along with damages easily repaired.
4. No unnecessary killing. Agreed upon or banter with your friends is fine, but if you have multiple offenses against you for repeated targetting, you're out.

## How are bedrock players able to play on the java server?

We use a mod called [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/) that translates bedrock players' incoming and outgoing data so that it can be read and processed by the java server.
Beware there are few known inconsistencies, the main one being that certain crafting recipies sadly don't seem to work for bedrock players on the server. A few examples are redstone comparators, sticky pistons, and hoppers.

## Extra Cool Features

- We use many performance-enhancing mods on the server to keep the lag down, and the fun up. A couple of those being [Lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric), and [Starlight](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight)
- Optional proximity voice chat! Sadly only for java players to enjoy, as it requires a mod to be installed on the player-end to join in on the fun. Head over to the `Voice Chat` section under `Features` for more info.
- Extremely configurable and positionable armor stands, head over to its section under `Features` for more info.
- Crafting tables have hopper support, meaning you can hook them up to complex redstone circuits and have them craft items automatically in farms and such. Head over to the `Auto Crafting` tab under `Features` for more info.
- Deepslate and logs are able to be insta-mined on this server. For more information on the necessary steps to achieve this, head over to the `Deepslate / Logs Instamine` tab under `Features`.
- End portals will be temporarily disabled - a couple months, most likely - to keep a slower pace for the server and prevent anyone from joining just to speedrun and leave.

## Updated Server Spawn

As was hinted in the `minecraft-announcements` channel of the discord, this server has an extra twist at the spawn area. For more specific details, head over to the `Spawn` tab under `Features`.
