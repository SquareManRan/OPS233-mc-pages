## Welcome

Here is everything you need to know to connect and play on the server.

## General Information

If you would like to join and play on the server:

- First, please make sure you are in the OPS233 Gaming club [discord server.](https://discord.gg/sa6EMFHMXS)
- Make sure you are using the same Minecraft version as the server, at the time of making this, we are in 1.17.0
- If you are a bedrock player, head over to your platform under the bedrock dropdown.
- The IP address for the Minecraft server is: rananddaninc.duckdns.org

## How are bedrock players able to play on the java server?

This is actually very cool! We use a mod called [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/) that translates bedrock players' incoming and outgoing data so that it can be read and processed by the java server.
Beware there a few known inconsistencies, the main one being that certian crafting recipies sadly don't seem to work for bedrock players on the server. A few examples are redstone comparators, sticky pistons, and hoppers.

## Extra Cool Features

- We use many performance-enhancing mods on the server to keep the lag down, and the fun up. A few of those being [Lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric), and [Starlight](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Starlight)
- Optional proximity voice chat! Sadly only for java players to enjoy, as it requires a mod to be installed on the player-end to join in on the fun. Head over to the `Voice Chat` section under `Mods` for more info.
- Extremely configurable and positionable armor stands, head over to its section under `Mods` for more info.
- Crafting tables have hopper support, meaning you can hook them up to complex redstone circuits and have them craft items automatically in farms and such. Head over to its tab under `Mods` for more info.
- We make use a database logging mod called [Ledger](https://quiltservertools.github.io/Ledger/1.0.0/), similar to the [Coreprotect](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/coreprotect.8631/) plugin for bukkit servers. It allows for checking of who broke or placed any block, a list of who took what from a chest and when, and much else. Check its tab under `Mods` for more detailed info. If you need something to be searched or looked up, ask one of the admins of the minecraft server.
