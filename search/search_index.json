Use the dropdowns on the side of this website to help navigate your way to all of the other info. This time around, we will not be starting over the world when the next update comes out. Enjoy! Connecting to the Server If you would like to join and play on the server: First, please make sure you are in the OPS233 Gaming club discord server. Make sure you are using the same Minecraft version as the server, at the time of making this, we are in 1.18.1 If you are a bedrock player, head over to your platform under the bedrock dropdown. The IP address for the Minecraft server is: OPS233.ddns.net Upon first connection, you will be refused to join, and told to type /link to link your account. You need a linked account to be able to play on the server. To do this, follow these steps: Attempt to connect to the Minecraft server, and stay on the screen that pops up. Join and open the OPS233 Gaming Club discord server. Navigate to the minecraft-server-chat text channel. In this channel, type /link code: followed by the code that is given to you in the link screen on Minecraft. Make sure that there is a space after the colon and before your code. Assuming you typed in the message correctly, your minecraft account should now be linked to your discord account, and you can try again to connect to the server and play. Don't worry, this information is not sent anywhere. This just keeps track on the management side of things what discord username aligns to which Minecraft accounts, for moderation purposes only. Rules No cheating. This includes xray and baritone, as well as cheat clients or other third party software designed to give you an advantage over other players. No hate speech or discrimination. No unnecessary griefing. Simple enough, don't destroy or steal other player's property. You'll just be found out and banned, along with damages easily repaired. No unnecessary killing. Agreed upon or banter with your friends is fine, but if you have multiple offenses against you for repeated targetting, you're out. How are bedrock players able to play on the java server? We use a mod called Geyser that translates bedrock players' incoming and outgoing data so that it can be read and processed by the java server. Beware there are few known inconsistencies, the main one being that certain crafting recipies sadly don't seem to work for bedrock players on the server. A few examples are redstone comparators, sticky pistons, and hoppers. Extra Cool Features We use many performance-enhancing mods on the server to keep the lag down, and the fun up. A couple of those being Lithium , and Starlight Extremely configurable and positionable armor stands, head over to its section under Features for more info. Crafting tables have hopper support, meaning you can hook them up to complex redstone circuits and have them craft items automatically in farms and such. Head over to the Auto Crafting tab under Features for more info. Deepslate and logs are able to be insta-mined on this server. For more information on the necessary steps to achieve this, head over to the Deepslate / Logs Instamine tab under Features . End portals will be temporarily disabled - a couple months, most likely - to keep a slower pace for the server and prevent anyone from joining just to speedrun and leave. Updated Server Spawn As was hinted in the minecraft-announcements channel of the discord, this server has an extra twist at the spawn area. For more specific details, head over to the Spawn tab under Features .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#home","text":"","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"This simple website should tell you everything you need to know about the Minecraft server's features, as well as how to connect and play.

As you can tell, something looks a bit different. Some of you may recognize that kind of generation, and yes, it is the farlands. Using some trickery and taking advantage of different world generation mechanics, I was able to brind the farlands to spawn. But don't worry! It only continues for a little over 300 blocks in each direction. After that, the farlands taper off, blending into the surrounding terrain. The rest of the server is 100% vanilla 1.18.1 world generation. The only thing changed is the center overworld spawn. Spawn protection rules Players cannot be hurt within center spawn protection. Blocks cannot be broken nor placed within center spawn protection. No kinds of mobs, peaceful or hostile, spawn within center spawn protection. Any mobs that are alredy there, you cannot hurt. Some blocks can be interacted with. For example: beds, doors, chests, enderchests, and barrels. Feel free to make use of any that you're able to. In the farlands area of spawn, the rules are set so everything happens almost fully normally, except that hostile mobs don't spawn. This is mainly for mobcap reasons. You are allowed to hang out or even base in the farlands, but it is greatly encouraged to branch out outside of the spawn generation instead.
